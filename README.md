These are some projects that I have worked on to showcase some of my skills in data engineering. Majority of these projects consists of me connecting to different apis and extracting the data typically in json format
Then making the appropriate changes. After the file formatting, cleaning, and conversions, I stored some of the retrieved data into Microsoft SQL Server and automated the process.
